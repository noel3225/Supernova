# Supernova 

Smart AI to keep people safe on beaches from all the dangers. It uses ML and real time data to inform people about UV Index, Weather forecasts, Tsunamis, Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs), Animal Attacks and RIP currents etc, all through just one app.

## Problems and Solution

**1. UV**

- Skin Cancer, other disorders.
- Damages immune system.
- Damages eyes.
- Ages skin.

**Solution**

- Show real time UV Index.
- Suggest users different precautions according to the UV Index.

**2. Harmful Algal Blooms AKA Red Tides (HABs)**

- Make people and animals sick.
- Toxic when ingested, can be fatal.

**Solution**

- Show different areas having HABs, to avoide.
- Suggest users beaches near them, which are HABs free and have good quality.


**3. RIP Currents**

- 80% of Rescues are due to RIP Currents.
- Kill more people then anything.

**Solution**

- Using ML to Identify RIP currents from a video.
- Dense optical flow analysis to detect flow (wave celerity and foam movement) from camera images. These flows are averaged over  many consecutive image pairs. 

**4. Other**

- Water Quality
- Climate – Lighting (33 people killed annually)
- Tsunamis
- Water Animals – Sharks, Jellyfish etc.

**Solution**

- *Water Quality:* Highlight areas with bad quality.
- *Climate – Lighting:* Weather forcast, plus weather alerts.
- *Tsunamis:* Weather forcast, plus weather alerts.
- *Water Animals:* Sonic senors and ML to detect animals, also warn people of harmful area.
