# Supernova 

Smart AI to keep people safe on beaches from all the dangers. It uses ML and real time data to inform people about UV Index, Weather forecasts, Tsunamis, Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs), Animal Attacks and RIP currents etc, all through just one app.

## Problems and Solution

**1. UV**

- Skin Cancer, other disorders.
- Damages immune system.
- Damages eyes.
- Ages skin.

**Solution**

- Show real time UV Index.
- Suggest users different precautions according to the UV Index.

**2. Harmful Algal Blooms AKA Red Tides (HABs)**

- Make people and animals sick.
- Toxic when ingested, can be fatal.

**Solution**

- Show different areas having HABs, to avoide.
- Suggest users beaches near them, which are HABs free and have good quality.


**3. RIP Currents**

- 80% of Rescues are due to RIP Currents.
- Kill more people then anything.

**Solution**

- Using ML to Identify RIP currents from a video.
- Dense optical flow analysis to detect flow (wave celerity and foam movement) from camera images. These flows are averaged over  many consecutive image pairs. 

**4. Other**

- Water Quality
- Climate – Lighting (33 people killed annually)
- Tsunamis
- Water Animals – Sharks, Jellyfish etc.

**Solution**

- *Water Quality:* Highlight areas with bad quality.
- *Climate – Lighting:* Weather forcast, plus weather alerts.
- *Tsunamis:* Weather forcast, plus weather alerts.
- *Water Animals:* Sonic senors and ML to detect animals, also warn people of harmful area.

```
This challenge addresses the following Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs), adopted by the United Nations General Assembly to
engage all countries and all stakeholders in a collaborative
partnership. The SDGs aim to build a better future for all people by
achieving sustainable development in three dimensions – economic,
social, and environmental – in the spirit of strengthened global
solidarity:

- Goal 1.5: By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in
vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and
vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other
economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters.

- Goal 11.5: By 2030, significantly reduce the number of deaths
and the number of people affected and substantially decrease
the direct economic losses relative to global gross domestic
product caused by disasters, including water-related disasters,
with a focus on protecting the poor and people in vulnerable
situations.

- Goal 13.1: Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to
climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries
