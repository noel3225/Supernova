# Supernova 

Smart AI to keep people safe on beaches from all the dangers. It uses ML to identify RIP Currents from a video and also inform people about UV Index, Weather forecasts, Tsunamis, Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs), Animal Attacks etc, all through just one app.

## Problems and Solution

**1. UV**

- Skin Cancer, other disorders.
- Damages immune system.
- Damages eyes.
- Ages skin.

**Solution**

- IOT device to sense UV radiation, show to users in real time.
- Using Public APIs to get UV radiation data, show to users.
- Suggest users different precautions according to the UV Index.

**2. Harmful Algal Blooms AKA Red Tides (HABs)**

- Make people and animals sick.
- Toxic when ingested, can be fatal.

**Solution**

- IOT device to check for HABs and Water Quality, show to users in real time.
- Public APIs to get HABs forcast and data, show to users.
- Suggest users beaches near them, which are HABs free and have good quality.


**3. RIP Currents**

- 80% of Rescues are due to RIP Currents.
- Kill more people then anything.

**Solution**

- No APIs to find that, Sensors can be used to find that, to inform users in real time.
- Infom people about the active RIP Currents.

**4. Other**

- Water Quality
- Climate – Lighting (33 people killed annually)
- Tsunamis
- Water Animals – Sharks, Jellyfish etc.

**Solution**

- *Water Quality:* APIs data to showcase that.
- *Climate – Lighting:* Weather forcast can solve it.
- *Tsunamis:* Weather forcast can solve that, also alearting users.
- *Water Animals:* sonic senors and ML to detect animals.
